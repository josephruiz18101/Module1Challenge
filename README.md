Started with startercode and asked the xpert Learning Assistant for information in meeting the requirements for challenge 1.
line 3-12 is from boot camp spot on the acceptance criteria.
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
I would ask the xpert Learning Assistant "what is semantic HTML elements" this helped me get a idea on how to approach the Challenge 1.
I proceeded to go down the line of acceptance criteria until I finished and I believe I finished it.
